# Canis Catalog

Canis Catalog is an Android app that allows the user to browse various dog breeds and check
information about them. The data is provided by [The Dog API](https://thedogapi.com/).

This project has been developed for the SwordHealth Android Code Challenge.

## Setup
Clone the repository and build the project, you should be ready to go :)

You will need to provide an API key for The Dog API.
This key must be placed in the ```local.properties``` file (if you don't have it, then please
create it in the root of project). Example of the file's content:
```
THE_DOG_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
```
